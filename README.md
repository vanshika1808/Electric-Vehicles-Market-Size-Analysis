# Electric Vehicles Market Analysis 

This project analyzes datasets related to Electric Vehicles (EVs) to uncover trends, detect outliers, and build a simple recommendation system.  
It also applies statistical hypothesis testing to compare manufacturers.  

## Objective  
To provide meaningful insights into EV market performance and help customers make better purchasing decisions through data-driven recommendations.  


## Key Activities  
- Filtered EVs based on **budget and range** criteria.  
- Grouped vehicles by manufacturer and calculated **average battery capacities**.  
- Visualized the relationship between **battery capacity and range**.  
- Detected **outliers in energy consumption** using data analysis.  
- Built an **EV Recommendation System** in Python where users can input budget, desired range, and battery capacity to find best matches.  
- Conducted **hypothesis testing** to compare **engine power of Tesla vs Audi**, drawing insights on performance differences.  


## Results  
- Identified clear relationships between **battery capacity and range**.  
- Recommendation system suggests EVs based on user needs.  
- Statistical testing revealed differences in **Tesla vs Audi performance**, supporting strategic business insights.
